### Top 3 most impactful features on the Linear Regression Model

* Item MRP 
    - It makes since that the item MRP would have the most importance since it directly affects the amount of revenue a store earns. The higher the prices are correlates to the amount of money the store makes.

* Outlet Type Grocery Store
* Outlet Type Supermarket Type 3

    - The other 2 most impactful features have to do with the outlet type. This shows sales can have positive or negative effects on the sales of a given store type. Certain outlet types may be located in easy to access areas and would typically generate more traffic leading to more sales. Also certain outlet types may have better layouts making it easier to access the things you need quicker.

### Top 3 most impactful features on the Random Forest model

* Item MRP 
    - As also stated in our Linear Regression model, it makes since that the item MRP would have the most importance since it directly affects the amount of revenue a store earns. The higher the prices are correlates to the amount of money the store makes.

* Outlet Type Grocery Store
    - This shows sales can have positive or negative effects on the sales of a given store type. Certain outlet types may be located in easy to access areas and would typically generate more traffic leading to more sales. Also certain outlet types may have better layouts making it easier to access the things you need quicker.
    
* Item Visibility
    - Speaking of outlet types with better layouts that also brings into question item visibility. Items that are easier to locate within a store would positively generate more sales. Items that are easier to locate would make the store a preference due to convenience of getting in and out of a store.

### Top 3 most important features based on the ShapDot plot
* Item MRP
    - Shows higher the MRP of an item increased our target
* Outlet Type Grocery Store
    - Grocery stores tend to decrease our target

* Outlet Type Supermarket Type 3
    - Type 3 increases our target
